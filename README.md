# Student Database Management System

## Description

This Java application provides a simple student database management system that allows users to add, edit, delete, and view student records. It leverages sorting and searching algorithms to manage and locate student data efficiently. The student records are stored in a file, and the data can be manipulated using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing.

### Key Features:
- **Add Student**: Allows users to input new student details (ID, name, grade).
- **Edit Student**: Enables users to modify existing student records by selecting the student ID.
- **Delete Student**: Provides the functionality to remove a student from the database.
- **View Student**: Displays student details based on their unique student ID.
- **Sorting**: Automatically sorts student records by their ID for efficient searching.
- **Search**: Implements binary search to quickly locate students by their student ID.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java Swing** for the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **BufferedReader** and **PrintWriter** for file handling (reading and writing student records).
- **Array of Student Objects** to store student data.
- **Sorting & Searching Algorithms** for managing student data efficiently.
